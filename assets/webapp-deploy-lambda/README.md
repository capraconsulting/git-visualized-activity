# webapp-deploy-lambda

This is only temporary until we have sorted out multi-region issues
with https://github.com/capraconsulting/webapp-deploy-lambda.
We have included that repo as a submodule here so that we can
embed it directly.

This folder is created separately so that we can use Code.fromAsset
and only getting the files we want.
